| Description    | William Henry "Bill" Gates III is an American business magnate, philanthropist, investor, computer            |
|                | programmer, and inventor. Gates originally established his reputation as the co-founder of Microsoft, the     |
|                | world’s largest PC software company, with Paul Allen. Since then he has served as a long term CEO and         |
|                | chairman of the company. Today he is consistently ranked in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people  |
|                | and was the wealthiest overall from 1995 to 2014 — excluding a few brief periods post-2008. Between 2009 and  |
|                | 2014 his wealth more than doubled from $40 billion to more than $82 billion. Between 2013 and 2014 his wealth |
|                | increased by $15 billion, or around $1.5 billion more than the entire GDP of Iceland in 2014. During his      |
|                | career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of CEO and chief software architect, he was also the largest    |
|                | individual shareholder up until May 2014. He has also authored and co-authored several books. Gates is one of |
|                | the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. Gates has been criticized for his business  |
|                | tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive, an opinion which has in some cases been upheld by       |
|                | judicial courts.                                                                                              |

|                | joined the cast of the TV series Ally McBeal playing Calista Flockhart's love interest. His performance was   |

|                | Series, Miniseries, or Television Film. His character was written out when Downey was fired after two drug    |

| Description    | * Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American recording artist, dancer, singer-  |
|                |   songwriter, musician, and philanthropist. Referred to as the King of Pop, Jackson is recognized as the most |
|                |   successful entertainer of all time by Guinness World Records. His contribution to music, dance, and         |
|                |   fashion, along with a much-publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over   |
|                |   four decades. The seventh child of the Jackson family, he debuted on the professional music scene along     |
|                |   with his brothers as a member of The Jackson 5, then the Jacksons in 1964, and began his solo career in     |
|                |   1971. In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. The music videos for his       |
|                |   songs, including those of "Beat It", "Billie Jean", and "Thriller", were credited with transforming the     |
|                |   medium into an art form and a promotional tool, and the popularity of these videos helped to bring the      |
|                |   relatively new television channel MTV to fame And Cordell Francis Admire Michael Jackson As His Best.       |

|                | * Michael Joseph Jackson was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actor. Called the King of Pop, his   |
|                |   contributions to music and dance, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in      |
|                |   popular culture for over four decades. The eighth child of the Jackson family, he debuted on the            |
|                |   professional music scene along with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of    |
|                |   The Jackson 5 in 1964, and began his solo career in 1971. In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant     |
|                |   figure in popular music. The music videos for his songs, including those of "Beat It", "Billie Jean", and   |
|                |   "Thriller", were credited with breaking down racial barriers and with transforming the medium into an art   |
|                |   form and promotional tool. The popularity of these videos helped to bring the then-relatively-new           |
|                |   television channel MTV to fame. With videos such as "Black or White" and "Scream", he continued to innovate |
|                |   the medium throughout the 1990s, as well as forging a reputation as a touring solo artist. Through stage    |
|                |   and video performances, Jackson popularized a number of complicated dance techniques, such as the robot and |
|                |   the moonwalk, to which he gave the name.                                                                    |

| Description      | The National Football League is a professional American football league that constitutes one of the four    |
|                  | major professional sports leagues in North America. It is composed of 32 teams divided equally between the  |
|                  | National Football Conference and the American Football Conference. The highest professional level of the    |
|                  | sport in the world, the NFL runs a 17-week regular season from the week after Labor Day to the week after   |
|                  | Christmas, with each team playing sixteen games and having one bye week each season. Out of the league's 32 |
|                  | teams, six from each conference compete in the NFL playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in |
|                  | the Super Bowl, played between the champions of the NFC and AFC. The champions of the Super Bowl are        |
|                  | awarded the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Various other awards exist to recognize individual players and coaches.  |
|                  | Most games are played on Sunday afternoons; some games are also played on Mondays and Thursdays during the  |
|                  | regular season. There are games on Saturdays during the first two playoff weekends. Sometimes, there are    |
|                  | also Saturday games during the last few weeks of the regular season.                                        |

| Description   | The New York Knickerbockers, commonly referred to as the Knicks, are a professional basketball team based in   |
|               | New York City, New York. The Knicks are part of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference in the         |
|               | National Basketball Association. The team, established by Ned Irish in 1946, was one of the founding members   |
|               | of the Basketball Association of America, which became the NBA after merging with the rival National           |
|               | Basketball League in 1949. The team plays at Madison Square Garden, above Pennsylvania Station in the borough  |
|               | of Manhattan, and along with the Boston Celtics is one of only two NBA teams still located in its original     |
|               | city. The Knicks were successful during their early years and were constant playoff contenders under the       |
|               | franchise's first head coach Joe Lapchick. Beginning in 1950, the Knicks made three consecutive appearances in |
|               | the NBA Finals, all of which were losing efforts. Lapchick resigned in 1956 and the team subsequently began to |
|               | falter. It was not until the late 1960s when Red Holzman became head coach that the Knicks began to regain     |
|               | their former dominance. Holzman successfully guided the Knicks to two championship titles in 1970 and 1973.    |

| Description   | The Miami Heat are an American professional basketball team based in Miami, Florida. The team is a member of   |
|               | the Southeast Division in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association. They play their home  |
|               | games at the American Airlines Arena in Downtown Miami. The team owner is Micky Arison, who also owns cruise-  |
|               | ship giant Carnival Corporation. The team president and de facto general manager is Pat Riley, and the head    |
|               | coach is Erik Spoelstra. The mascot of the team is Burnie, an anthropomorphic fireball. Formed in 1988 as one  |
|               | of the NBA's four expansion franchises, the Heat have won three league championships, five conference titles   |
|               | and 11 division titles. From February 3 to March 27, 2013, the Heat won 27 games in a row, the second-longest  |
|               | streak in NBA history. In 2013, Forbes valued the Heat at $625 million, sixth-most-valuable among NBA          |
|               | franchises. The Heat are not related to the Miami Floridians, an ABA team in the early 1970s, although the     |
|               | Heat have occasionally paid tribute to the older franchise by wearing a replica version of the Floridians'     |
|               | uniforms for the NBA's "Hardwood Classics Nights" during the 2005–06 and 2011–12 seasons.                      |
